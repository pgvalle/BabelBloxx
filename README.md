# SpaceInvaders Clone

This game, as the name suggests, is yet another 1978 Arcade [SpaceInvaders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders)' clone.
Obviously It's not 100% the same as the original one. But I guarantee it's good enough to be called Space Invaders Clone.

# Build instructions

## Linux
`$ git clone https://github.com/pgvalle/SpaceInvadersClone`\
`$ cd SpaceInvadersClone`\
`$ make`\
`$ cp -r res/ build/` or `$ cp build/SpaceInvadersClone.out .`

Now you're done. That last step is really important because the executable must be in the same directory as res/

## Windows
To be documented...
