# SpaceInvaders Clone

This game, as the name suggests, is yet another 1978 Arcade [SpaceInvaders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders)' clone.
Obviously It's not 100% the same as the original one. But It's close enough.

# Build from Source

If you are on Windows, build with cmake and visual studio. Otherwise, you may use that or the makefile if you want.

**NOTE**: If you get any errors, it probably has something to do with the include directives to sdl stuff in Application.h.
Or the app itself is broken. :P
